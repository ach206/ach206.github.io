                    I've found myself learning not to accept no for an answer
                    &mdash;at least not the <em>first</em> no. When I think of
                    pioneers who've paved the way in front of me I have to think
                    about all the times they've heard "no" or better yet "you can't".
                    That answer is just unacceptable. <strong>I can. I will.</strong>
                    Together we can start dissolving these old ways of thinking and
                    shift our energy towards collective development for a better future.
